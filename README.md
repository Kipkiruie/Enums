# Java Enum Practice

This is a simple Java console application that demonstrates the use of **Enums** and **`switch` statements** to classify days of the week as either weekdays or weekends.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Covers

- **Enums**: Special types that represent fixed sets of constants (in this case, days of the week).
- **`switch` expressions**: Modern `switch` syntax using arrow notation.
- **Input handling**: Using `Scanner` to read user input from the console.
- **Exception handling**: Gracefully managing invalid enum input with a `try-catch` block.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

| Concept          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `enum`           | Used to define a fixed set of named constants (`MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, etc.) |
| `switch`         | Determines if a day is a **weekday** or **weekend** |
| `Scanner`        | Captures user input from the command line |
| `try-catch`      | Handles cases where user input doesn't match a valid `enum` |

## âœ… Example Run
